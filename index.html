         <p>Bali is known as the Island of the Gods for a reason. It's one of 17,500 islands in the Indonesian archipelago, yet even among its colorful neighbors-and even after decades of tourism development-it stands alone in its incomparable beauty. It is part of the Coral Triangle, which has the highest diversity of marine species on earth, making the coral reefs that surround the island a spectacular sight. Despite the island's small size, its population holds most of Indonesia's Hindu minority. Bali is known for surfing, ancient temples, and palaces, but also has active volcanoes and wild jungles. It has white-sand beaches in the south, and striking black sand in the north and west.</p>
         <p>Bali has been a popular tourist destination for travelers from all over the world, but especially Australians and Americans, for the past few decades. As a result, the island is well accustomed to meeting the needs of international tourists. Our "Wonderful Bali - Bali Travel Guide" will help you make the perfect trip to see Bali's ancient and natural wonders.</p>
